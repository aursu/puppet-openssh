# UsePrivilegeSeparation
#   Specifies whether sshd(8) separates privileges by creating an unprivileged
#   child process to deal with incoming network traffic.  After successful
#   authentication, another process will be created that has the privilege of
#   the authenticated user.  The goal of privilege separation is to prevent
#   privilege escalation by containing any corruption within the unprivileged
#   processes.  The default is "yes".
openssh::use_privilege_separation: 'yes'

# Protocol
#   Specifies the protocol versions sshd(8) supports. The possible values are
#   '1' and '2'. Multiple versions must be comma-separated. The default is
#   "2,1".  Note that the order of the protocol list does not indicate
#   preference, because the client selects among multiple protocol versions
#   offered by the server.  Specifying "2,1" is identical to "1,2"
openssh::protocol: 2
