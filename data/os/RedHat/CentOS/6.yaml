# UsePrivilegeSeparation
#   Specifies whether sshd(8) separates privileges by creating an unprivileged
#   child process to deal with incoming network traffic.  After successful
#   authentication, another process will be created that has the privilege of
#   the authenticated user.  The goal of privilege separation is to prevent
#   privilege escalation by containing any corruption within the unprivileged
#   processes.  The default is "yes".
openssh::use_privilege_separation: 'yes'
